How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Using the command diff -u gives a detailed explaination with the help of - + 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You have track of what changes you have done over a period of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros - not many commits are created.
cons - you lose track of what changes you have done.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In the development of webpages the html and css files are linked so we can't compare them separately. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives the detailed information about every commit. git diff id1 id2 can be used to count the number of additions and subtractions implemented between the two commit commit. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

if we encounter a bug in a new commit we can always go back to the previous commit by getting the commit id from the git log command.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
